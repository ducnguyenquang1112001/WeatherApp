# User manual

Our Weather App is the one you can use to check your weather right now, weather forecast and
past weather as well.

Different from other applications in the market, we have one of the most user-intuitive graphical
user interfaces.

You can quickly search for your own place, add it to your favorite list and see how the weather
there looks at any time.

You also can see the weather in the past by selecting the ‘Historical weather’ button and
preferred date in the ‘Preference‘ section.

After that, all you need is to press the ‘See the weather’ button to find out how the weather looks
there

If you like, you can go back and play around without forgetting the old places saved in search
history on the left side

Want to feel more familiar? You can change the displayed unit and greeting name in the
‘Preference’ section. For the nerds out there, the API key should be only changed with caution,
and there is always a reset button to revert all the changes.

#  Installation instruction
The Weather App’s JAR file is located in the ‘Release’ folder of the group’s root directory. You
can run it by using the command line, which is ‘java -jar "weather_app_release.jar"”’ at the
‘Release’ folder’s directory.
